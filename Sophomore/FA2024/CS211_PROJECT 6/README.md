# Escape the Labyrinth (snapshot)

**Course:** CS 211 – Programming Practicum  
**Semester:** Fall 2024  
**Language:** C (headers only)

## Project summary
This program finds a valid escape path from a personalized labyrinth while collecting the **Spellbook, Potion, and Wand**.  
The assignment challenged me to design data structures and algorithms capable of finding a valid path through a maze.

Working on this problem sharpened my understanding of breadth-first search, grid representations, and memory-safe design in C.
